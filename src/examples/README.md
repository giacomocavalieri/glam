# Pretty printing examples

Here you can find some examples of pretty printing with the Glam library.

Most likely, all files here are also explained in depth in the
[step-by-step tutorials](https://hexdocs.pm/glam/learning_materials.html)
I wrote for the library.
So, if you find anything confusing, you can have a look at those! If you're
still confused by something, please _do reach out_, I'd love to hear your
feedback and help you ðŸ’œ
